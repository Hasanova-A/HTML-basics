    <p id="style">In June 2013, Rihanna trademarked her surname, Fenty, for use on various and more products, leading to speculation that she would begin working on endeavors other than her music<sup>[1]</sup>. Fenty Beauty was among these new trademarks<sup>[2][3]</sup>.<br>
    Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty in 2017, when she was 29 years old.[4] Previously, she had collaborated with MAC Cosmetics<sup>[5][6]</sup>, as well as released 10 fragrances via Parlux Ltd<sup>[7][8][9]</sup>, but Fenty Beauty was her first solo cosmetics brand<sup>[10]</sup>. She developed the line with luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey (LVMH), signing a deal in 2016, to produce Fenty Beauty through LVMH's Kendo division<sup>[7]</sup>. Kendo Holdings, Inc is an "incubator" company that manufactures cosmetics as white-label products[11] for sale through cosmetics retailer Sephora, another LVMH subsidiary, as well as other outlets<sup>[7]</sup>. Women's Wear Daily reported that LVMH may have paid $10 million (USD) for the agreement, which followed Kendo deals to produce Marc Jacobs Beauty and Kat Von D Beauty lines<sup>[7]</sup>.

    Rihanna created Fenty Beauty to provide an inclusive range for all skin tones, including extensive shade offerings for people with deeper skin tones, thus adding items to fill the void of products that performed across all skin tones and types<sup>[12]</sup>.
